# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in Melbourne using the Melbourne Housing Snapshot dataset. The model is built using the XGBoost regression algorithm, which is known for its efficiency and performance in regression tasks.

## Features

- Predicts housing prices based on key features such as the number of rooms, distance to the city center, land size, building area, and year built.
- Implements hyperparameter tuning and early stopping to enhance model performance.
